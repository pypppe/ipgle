## ❓ How does it work?

1. There's a "search" bar, and it'll show 3 questions.
2. "What is my IP"
3. "Download VPN"
4. Last but not least, "What is an IP?"

## 🚫 Ads & Promotions

We believe ads ruin the fun.  
**IPgle** is a **completely free** site made for no reason. Not for profit.

This project exists purely **for fun**, not commercialization. ✨

## 🛡️ Privacy & Data

Your privacy is important to us.  
**iPgle does NOT:**
- Track your location  
- Collect personal data  
- And we don't store the IP.

You can enjoy the site safely, with no worries about privacy.
